  <h1>Guadalupe Gamero</h1>
  <p>3330 S Michigan Avenue</p>
  <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>

<div class="who">
  <p>Preferred name: Guad Gamero</p>
  <p>Any pronouns</p>
  <p>I'm currently a third year with few achievements to my name and no projects under my belt.</p>
  <p>I speak both English and Spanish, though I am unable to write in the latter. This Spanish is not suited for a professional environment.</p>
  <p>A fan artist on the side, I've yet to reach a level of confidence to open commissions. There's no art portfolio or blog I can link here.</p>
  <p>I currently hold two student organization executive board positions.</p>
  <p>I am the President of Prism, an organization that seeks to make IIT an accepting space for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
  <p>I also serve as LIFE's (Latinos Involved in Further Education) secretary. This organization fosters a community for Latinos and provides scholarship opportunities and career workshops.</p>
  <p>This is my first professional website! Hopefully, this About Me page will have more impressive content before graduation.</p>
